## Naming

### Naming Guidelines
###### [Style [Y120](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y120)]

  - Use consistent names for all components following a pattern that describes the component's feature then (optionally) its type. My recommended pattern is `feature.type.js`. There are 2 names for most assets:
    * the file name (`avengers.controller.js`)
    * the registered component name with Angular (`AvengersController`)

    *Why?*: Naming conventions help provide a consistent way to find content at a glance. Consistency within the project is vital. Consistency with a team is important. Consistency across a company provides tremendous efficiency.

    *Why?*: The naming conventions should simply help you find your code faster and make it easier to understand.

### Feature File Names
###### [Style [Y121](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y121)]

  - Use consistent names for all components following a pattern that describes the component's feature then (optionally) its type. My recommended pattern is `feature.type.js`.

    *Why?*: Provides a consistent way to quickly identify components.

    *Why?*: Provides pattern matching for any automated tasks.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * common options
     */

    // Controllers
    avengers.js
    avengers.controller.js
    avengersController.js

    // Services/Factories
    logger.js
    logger.service.js
    loggerService.js
    ```

    ```javascript
    /**
     * recommended
     */

    // controllers
    avengers.controller.js
    avengers.controller.spec.js

    // services/factories
    logger.service.js
    logger.service.spec.js

    // constants
    constants.js

    // module definition
    avengers.module.js

    // routes
    avengers.routes.js
    avengers.routes.spec.js

    // configuration
    avengers.config.js

    // directives
    avenger-profile.directive.js
    avenger-profile.directive.spec.js
    ```

  Note: Another common convention is naming controller files without the word `controller` in the file name such as `avengers.js` instead of `avengers.controller.js`. All other conventions still hold using a suffix of the type. Controllers are the most common type of component so this just saves typing and is still easily identifiable. I recommend you choose 1 convention and be consistent for your team. My preference is `avengers.controller.js` identifying the `AvengersController`.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * recommended
     */
    // Controllers
    avengers.js
    avengers.spec.js
    ```

### Test File Names
###### [Style [Y122](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y122)]

  - Name test specifications similar to the component they test with a suffix of `spec`.

    *Why?*: Provides a consistent way to quickly identify components.

    *Why?*: Provides pattern matching for [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) or other test runners.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * recommended
     */
    avengers.controller.spec.js
    logger.service.spec.js
    avengers.routes.spec.js
    avenger-profile.directive.spec.js
    ```

### Controller Names
###### [Style [Y123](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y123)]

  - Use consistent names for all controllers named after their feature. Use UpperCamelCase for controllers, as they are constructors.

    *Why?*: Provides a consistent way to quickly identify and reference controllers.

    *Why?*: UpperCamelCase is conventional for identifying object that can be instantiated using a constructor.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * recommended
     */

    // avengers.controller.js
    angular
        .module
        .controller('HeroAvengersController', HeroAvengersController);

    function HeroAvengersController() { }
    ```

### Controller Name Suffix
###### [Style [Y124](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y124)]

  - Append the controller name with the suffix `Controller`.

    *Why?*: The `Controller` suffix is more commonly used and is more explicitly descriptive.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * recommended
     */

    // avengers.controller.js
    angular
        .module
        .controller('AvengersController', AvengersController);

    function AvengersController() { }
    ```

### Factory and Service Names
###### [Style [Y125](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y125)]

  - Use consistent names for all factories and services named after their feature. Use camel-casing for services and factories. Avoid prefixing factories and services with `$`. Only suffix service and factories with `Service` when it is not clear what they are (i.e. when they are nouns).

    *Why?*: Provides a consistent way to quickly identify and reference factories.

    *Why?*: Avoids name collisions with built-in factories and services that use the `$` prefix.

    *Why?*: Clear service names such as `logger` do not require a suffix.

    *Why?*: Service names such as `avengers` are nouns and require a suffix and should be named `avengersService`.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * recommended
     */

    // logger.service.js
    angular
        .module
        .factory('logger', logger);

    function logger() { }
    ```

    ```javascript
    /**
     * recommended
     */

    // credit.service.js
    angular
        .module
        .factory('creditService', creditService);

    function creditService() { }

    // customer.service.js
    angular
        .module
        .service('customerService', customerService);

    function customerService() { }
    ```

### Directive Component Names
###### [Style [Y126](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y126)]

  - Use consistent names for all directives using camel-case. Use a short prefix to describe the area that the directives belong (some example are company prefix or project prefix).

    *Why?*: Provides a consistent way to quickly identify and reference components.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * recommended
     */

    // avenger-profile.directive.js
    angular
        .module
        .directive('xxAvengerProfile', xxAvengerProfile);

    // usage is <xx-avenger-profile> </xx-avenger-profile>

    function xxAvengerProfile() { }
    ```

### Modules
###### [Style [Y127](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y127)]

  - When there are multiple modules, the main module file is named `app.module.js` while other dependent modules are named after what they represent. For example, an admin module is named `admin.module.js`. The respective registered module names would be `app` and `admin`.

    *Why?*: Provides consistency for multiple module apps, and for expanding to large applications.

    *Why?*: Provides easy way to use task automation to load all module definitions first, then all other angular files (for bundling).

### Configuration
###### [Style [Y128](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y128)]

  - Separate configuration for a module into its own file named after the module. A configuration file for the main `app` module is named `app.config.js` (or simply `config.js`). A configuration for a module named `admin.module.js` is named `admin.config.js`.

    *Why?*: Separates configuration from module definition, components, and active code.

    *Why?*: Provides an identifiable place to set configuration for a module.

### Routes
###### [Style [Y129](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y129)]

  - Separate route configuration into its own file. Examples might be `app.route.js` for the main module and `admin.route.js` for the `admin` module. Even in smaller apps I prefer this separation from the rest of the configuration.



## Application Structure LIFT Principle
### LIFT
###### [Style [Y140](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y140)]

  - Structure your app such that you can `L`ocate your code quickly, `I`dentify the code at a glance, keep the `F`lattest structure you can, and `T`ry to stay DRY. The structure should follow these 4 basic guidelines.

    *Why LIFT?*: Provides a consistent structure that scales well, is modular, and makes it easier to increase developer efficiency by finding code quickly. Another way to check your app structure is to ask yourself: How quickly can you open and work in all of the related files for a feature?

    When I find my structure is not feeling comfortable, I go back and revisit these LIFT guidelines

    1. `L`ocating our code is easy
    2. `I`dentify code at a glance
    3. `F`lat structure as long as we can
    4. `T`ry to stay DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) or T-DRY

### Locate
###### [Style [Y141](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y141)]

  - Make locating your code intuitive, simple and fast.

    *Why?*: I find this to be super important for a project. If the team cannot find the files they need to work on quickly, they will not be able to work as efficiently as possible, and the structure needs to change. You may not know the file name or where its related files are, so putting them in the most intuitive locations and near each other saves a ton of time. A descriptive folder structure can help with this.

    ```
    /bower_components
    /client
      /app
        /avengers
        /blocks
          /exception
          /logger
        /core
        /dashboard
        /data
        /layout
        /widgets
      /content
      index.html
    .bower.json
    ```

### Identify
###### [Style [Y142](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y142)]

  - When you look at a file you should instantly know what it contains and represents.

    *Why?*: You spend less time hunting and pecking for code, and become more efficient. If this means you want longer file names, then so be it. Be descriptive with file names and keeping the contents of the file to exactly 1 component. Avoid files with multiple controllers, multiple services, or a mixture. There are deviations of the 1 per file rule when I have a set of very small features that are all related to each other, they are still easily identifiable.

### Flat
###### [Style [Y143](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y143)]

  - Keep a flat folder structure as long as possible. When you get to 7+ files, begin considering separation.

    *Why?*: Nobody wants to search 7 levels of folders to find a file. Think about menus on web sites … anything deeper than 2 should take serious consideration. In a folder structure there is no hard and fast number rule, but when a folder has 7-10 files, that may be time to create subfolders. Base it on your comfort level. Use a flatter structure until there is an obvious value (to help the rest of LIFT) in creating a new folder.

### T-DRY (Try to Stick to DRY)
###### [Style [Y144](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y144)]

  - Be DRY, but don't go nuts and sacrifice readability.

    *Why?*: Being DRY is important, but not crucial if it sacrifices the others in LIFT, which is why I call it T-DRY. I don’t want to type session-view.html for a view because, well, it’s obviously a view. If it is not obvious or by convention, then I name it.



## Application Structure

### Overall Guidelines
###### [Style [Y150](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y150)]

  - Have a near term view of implementation and a long term vision. In other words, start small but keep in mind on where the app is heading down the road. All of the app's code goes in a root folder named `app`. All content is 1 feature per file. Each controller, service, module, view is in its own file. All 3rd party vendor scripts are stored in another root folder and not in the `app` folder. I didn't write them and I don't want them cluttering my app (`bower_components`, `scripts`, `lib`).

    Note: Find more details and reasoning behind the structure at [this original post on application structure](http://www.johnpapa.net/angular-app-structuring-guidelines/).

### Layout
###### [Style [Y151](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y151)]

  - Place components that define the overall layout of the application in a folder named `layout`. These may include a shell view and controller may act as the container for the app, navigation, menus, content areas, and other regions.

    *Why?*: Organizes all layout in a single place re-used throughout the application.

### Folders-by-Feature Structure
###### [Style [Y152](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y152)]

  - Create folders named for the feature they represent. When a folder grows to contain more than 7 files, start to consider creating a folder for them. Your threshold may be different, so adjust as needed.

    *Why?*: A developer can locate the code, identify what each file represents at a glance, the structure is flat as can be, and there is no repetitive nor redundant names.

    *Why?*: The LIFT guidelines are all covered.

    *Why?*: Helps reduce the app from becoming cluttered through organizing the content and keeping them aligned with the LIFT guidelines.

    *Why?*: When there are a lot of files (10+) locating them is easier with a consistent folder structures and more difficult in flat structures.

    /**

            sessions.routes.js

            session-detail.controller.js
    ```

      ![Sample App Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/master/a1/assets/modularity-2.png)

      Note: Do not structure your app using folders-by-type. This requires moving to multiple folders when working on a feature and gets unwieldy quickly as the app grows to 5, 10 or 25+ views and controllers (and other features), which makes it more difficult than folder-by-feature to locate files.

    ```javascript
    /*
    * avoid
    * Alternative folders-by-type.
    * I recommend "folders-by-feature", instead.
    */

        app.module.js
        app.config.js
        app.routes.js

            speakers.html
            speaker-detail.html
            topnav.html
    ```



## Modularity

### Many Small, Self Contained Modules
###### [Style [Y160](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y160)]

  - Create small modules that encapsulate one responsibility.

    *Why?*: Modular applications make it easy to plug and go as they allow the development teams to build vertical slices of the applications and roll out incrementally. This means we can plug in new features as we develop them.

### Create an App Module
###### [Style [Y161](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y161)]

  - Create an application root module whose role is to pull together all of the modules and features of your application. Name this for your application.

    *Why?*: Angular encourages modularity and separation patterns. Creating an application root module whose role is to tie your other modules together provides a very straightforward way to add or remove modules from your application.

### Keep the App Module Thin
###### [Style [Y162](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y162)]

  - Only put logic for pulling together the app in the application module. Leave features in their own modules.

    *Why?*: Adding additional roles to the application root to get remote data, display views, or other logic not related to pulling the app together muddies the app module and make both sets of features harder to reuse or turn off.

    *Why?*: The app module becomes a manifest that describes which modules help define the application.

### Feature Areas are Modules
###### [Style [Y163](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y163)]

  - Create modules that represent feature areas, such as layout, reusable and shared services, dashboards, and app specific features (e.g. customers, admin, sales).

    *Why?*: Self contained modules can be added to the application with little or no friction.

    *Why?*: Sprints or iterations can focus on feature areas and turn them on at the end of the sprint or iteration.

    *Why?*: Separating feature areas into modules makes it easier to test the modules in isolation and reuse code.

### Reusable Blocks are Modules
###### [Style [Y164](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y164)]

  - Create modules that represent reusable application blocks for common services such as exception handling, logging, diagnostics, security, and local data stashing.

    *Why?*: These types of features are needed in many applications, so by keeping them separated in their own modules they can be application generic and be reused across applications.

### Module Dependencies
###### [Style [Y165](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y165)]

  - The application root module depends on the app specific feature modules and any shared or reusable modules.

    ![Modularity and Dependencies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/master/a1/assets/modularity-1.png)

    *Why?*: The main app module contains a quickly identifiable manifest of the application's features.

    *Why?*: Each feature area contains a manifest of what it depends on, so it can be pulled in as a dependency in other applications and still work.

    *Why?*: Intra-App features such as shared data services become easy to locate and share from within `app.core` (choose your favorite name for this module).

    Note: This is a strategy for consistency. There are many good options here. Choose one that is consistent, follows Angular's dependency rules, and is easy to maintain and scale.

    > My structures vary slightly between projects but they all follow these guidelines for structure and modularity. The implementation may vary depending on the features and the team. In other words, don't get hung up on an exact like-for-like structure but do justify your structure using consistency, maintainability, and efficiency in mind.

    > In a small app, you can also consider putting all the shared dependencies in the app module where the feature modules have no direct dependencies. This makes it easier to maintain the smaller application, but makes it harder to reuse modules outside of this application.



## Startup Logic

### Configuration
###### [Style [Y170](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y170)]

  - Inject code into [module configuration](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module#module-loading-dependencies) that must be configured before running the angular app. Ideal candidates include providers and constants.

    *Why?*: This makes it easier to have less places for configuration.

  ```javascript
  angular
      .module('app')
      .config(configure);

  configure.$inject =
      ['routerHelperProvider', 'exceptionHandlerProvider', 'toastr'];

  function configure (routerHelperProvider, exceptionHandlerProvider, toastr) {
      exceptionHandlerProvider.configure(config.appErrorPrefix);
      configureStateHelper();

      toastr.options.timeOut = 4000;
      toastr.options.positionClass = 'toast-bottom-right';

      ////////////////

      function configureStateHelper() {
          routerHelperProvider.configure({
              docTitle: 'NG-Modular: '
          });
      }
  }
  ```

### Run Blocks
###### [Style [Y171](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y171)]

  - Any code that needs to run when an application starts should be declared in a factory, exposed via a function, and injected into the [run block](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module#module-loading-dependencies).

    *Why?*: Code directly in a run block can be difficult to test. Placing in a factory makes it easier to abstract and mock.

  ```javascript
  angular
      .module('app')
      .run(runBlock);

  runBlock.$inject = ['authenticator', 'translator'];

  function runBlock(authenticator, translator) {
      authenticator.initialize();
      translator.initialize();
  }
  ```







## Testing
Unit testing helps maintain clean code, as such I included some of my recommendations for unit testing foundations with links for more information.

### Write Tests with Stories
###### [Style [Y190](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y190)]

  - Write a set of tests for every story. Start with an empty test and fill them in as you write the code for the story.

    *Why?*: Writing the test descriptions helps clearly define what your story will do, will not do, and how you can measure success.

    ```javascript
    it('should have Avengers controller', function() {
        // TODO
    });

    it('should find 1 Avenger when filtered by name', function() {
        // TODO
    });

    it('should have 10 Avengers', function() {
        // TODO (mock data?)
    });

    it('should return Avengers via XHR', function() {
        // TODO ($httpBackend?)
    });

    // and so on
    ```

### Testing Library
###### [Style [Y191](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y191)]

  - Use [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) or [Mocha](http://mochajs.org) for unit testing.

    *Why?*: Both Jasmine and Mocha are widely used in the Angular community. Both are stable, well maintained, and provide robust testing features.

    Note: When using Mocha, also consider choosing an assert library such as [Chai](http://chaijs.com). I prefer Mocha.

### Test Runner
###### [Style [Y192](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y192)]

  - Use [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) as a test runner.

    *Why?*: Karma is easy to configure to run once or automatically when you change your code.

    *Why?*: Karma hooks into your Continuous Integration process easily on its own or through Grunt or Gulp.

    *Why?*: Some IDE's are beginning to integrate with Karma, such as [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/02f47876-0e7a-4f6c-93f8-1af5d5189225).

    *Why?*: Karma works well with task automation leaders such as [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) (with [grunt-karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/grunt-karma)) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). When using Gulp, use [Karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma) directly and not with a plugin as the API can be called directly.

    ```javascript
    /* recommended */

    // Gulp example with Karma directly
    function startTests(singleRun, done) {
        var child;
        var excludeFiles = [];
        var fork = require('child_process').fork;
        var karma = require('karma').server;
        var serverSpecs = config.serverIntegrationSpecs;

        if (args.startServers) {
            log('Starting servers');
            var savedEnv = process.env;
            savedEnv.NODE_ENV = 'dev';
            savedEnv.PORT = 8888;
            child = fork(config.nodeServer);
        } else {
            if (serverSpecs && serverSpecs.length) {
                excludeFiles = serverSpecs;
            }
        }

        karma.start({
            configFile: __dirname + '/karma.conf.js',
            exclude: excludeFiles,
            singleRun: !!singleRun
        }, karmaCompleted);

        ////////////////

        function karmaCompleted(karmaResult) {
            log('Karma completed');
            if (child) {
                log('shutting down the child process');
                child.kill();
            }
            if (karmaResult === 1) {
                done('karma: tests failed with code ' + karmaResult);
            } else {
                done();
            }

    }
    ```

### Stubbing and Spying
###### [Style [Y193](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y193)]

  - Use [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) for stubbing and spying.

    *Why?*: Sinon works well with both Jasmine and Mocha and extends the stubbing and spying features they offer.

    *Why?*: Sinon makes it easier to toggle between Jasmine and Mocha, if you want to try both.

    *Why?*: Sinon has descriptive messages when tests fail the assertions.

### Headless Browser
###### [Style [Y194](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y194)]

  - Use [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) to run your tests on a server.

    *Why?*: PhantomJS is a headless browser that helps run your tests without needing a "visual" browser. So you do not have to install Chrome, Safari, IE, or other browsers on your server.

    Note: You should still test on all browsers in your environment, as appropriate for your target audience.

### Code Analysis
###### [Style [Y195](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y195)]

  - Run JSHint on your tests.

    *Why?*: Tests are code. JSHint can help identify code quality issues that may cause the test to work improperly.

### Alleviate Globals for JSHint Rules on Tests
###### [Style [Y196](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y196)]

  - Relax the rules on your test code to allow for common globals such as `describe` and `expect`. Relax the rules for expressions, as Mocha uses these.

    *Why?*: Your tests are code and require the same attention and code quality rules as all of your production code. However, global variables used by the testing framework, for example, can be relaxed by including this in your test specs.

    ```javascript
    /* jshint -W117, -W030 */
    ```
    Or you can add the following to your JSHint Options file.

    ```javascript
    "jasmine": true,
    "mocha": true,
    ```

### Organizing Tests
###### [Style [Y197](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y197)]

  - Place unit test files (specs) side-by-side with your client code. Place specs that cover server integration or test multiple components in a separate `tests` folder.

    *Why?*: Unit tests have a direct correlation to a specific component and file in source code.

    *Why?*: It is easier to keep them up to date since they are always in sight. When coding whether you do TDD or test during development or test after development, the specs are side-by-side and never out of sight nor mind, and thus more likely to be maintained which also helps maintain code coverage.

    *Why?*: When you update source code it is easier to go update the tests at the same time.

    *Why?*: Placing them side-by-side makes it easy to find them and easy to move them with the source code if you move the source.

    *Why?*: Having the spec nearby makes it easier for the source code reader to learn how the component is supposed to be used and to discover its known limitations.

    *Why?*: Separating specs so they are not in a distributed build is easy with grunt or gulp.

    ```
    /src/client/app/customers/customer-detail.controller.js
                             /customer-detail.controller.spec.js
                             /customers.controller.js
                             /customers.controller.spec.js
                             /customers.module.js
                             /customers.route.js
                             /customers.route.spec.js
    ```



## Animations

### Usage
###### [Style [Y210](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y210)]

  - Use subtle [animations with Angular](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/animations) to transition between states for views and primary visual elements. Include the [ngAnimate module](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate). The 3 keys are subtle, smooth, seamless.

    *Why?*: Subtle animations can improve User Experience when used appropriately.

    *Why?*: Subtle animations can improve perceived performance as views transition.

### Sub Second
###### [Style [Y211](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y211)]

  - Use short durations for animations. I generally start with 300ms and adjust until appropriate.

    *Why?*: Long animations can have the reverse effect on User Experience and perceived performance by giving the appearance of a slow application.

### animate.css
###### [Style [Y212](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y212)]

  - Use [animate.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) for conventional animations.

    *Why?*: The animations that animate.css provides are fast, smooth, and easy to add to your application.

    *Why?*: Provides consistency in your animations.

    *Why?*: animate.css is widely used and tested.

    Note: See this [great post by Matias Niemelä on Angular animations](http://www.yearofmoo.com/2013/08/remastered-animation-in-angularjs-1-2.html)



## Comments

### jsDoc
###### [Style [Y220](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y220)]

  - If planning to produce documentation, use [`jsDoc`](http://usejsdoc.org/) syntax to document function names, description, params and returns. Use `@namespace` and `@memberOf` to match your app structure.

    *Why?*: You can generate (and regenerate) documentation from your code, instead of writing it from scratch.

    *Why?*: Provides consistency using a common industry tool.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * Logger Factory
     * @namespace Factories
     */
    (function() {
      angular
          .module('app')
          .factory('logger', logger);

      /**
       * @namespace Logger
       * @desc Application wide logger
       * @memberOf Factories
       */
      function logger($log) {
          var service = {
             logError: logError
          };
          return service;

          ////////////

          /**
           * @name logError
           * @desc Logs errors
           * @param {String} msg Message to log
           * @returns {String}
           * @memberOf Factories.Logger
           */
          function logError(msg) {
              var loggedMsg = 'Error: ' + msg;
              $log.error(loggedMsg);
              return loggedMsg;
          };
      }
    })();
    ```

## Constants

### Vendor Globals
###### [Style [Y240](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y240)]

  - Create an Angular Constant for vendor libraries' global variables.

    *Why?*: Provides a way to inject vendor libraries that otherwise are globals. This improves code testability by allowing you to more easily know what the dependencies of your components are (avoids leaky abstractions). It also allows you to mock these dependencies, where it makes sense.

    ```javascript
    // constants.js

    /* global toastr:false, moment:false */
    (function() {
        'use strict';

        angular
            .module('app.core')
            .constant('toastr', toastr)
            .constant('moment', moment);
    })();
    ```
