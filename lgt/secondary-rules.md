# LGT SmartBanking Style Guide Backlog

## Purpose
This file contains the rules which we think are not all too important or somehow duplicates of other rules.
However, they are not considered wrong and it's good to know them (and it certainly does not hurt to follow them).


## Directives

### Limit 1 Per File
###### [Style [Y070](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y070)]

  - Create one directive per file. Name the file for the directive.

    *Why?*: It is easy to mash all the directives in one file, but difficult to then break those out so some are shared across apps, some across modules, some just for one module.

    *Why?*: One directive per file is easy to maintain.

    > Note: "**Best Practice**: Directives should clean up after themselves. You can use `element.on('$destroy', ...)` or `scope.$on('$destroy', ...)` to run a clean-up function when the directive is removed" ... from the Angular documentation.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  /* directives.js */

  angular
      .module('app.widgets')

      /* order directive that is specific to the order module */
      .directive('orderCalendarRange', orderCalendarRange)

      /* sales directive that can be used anywhere across the sales app */
      .directive('salesCustomerInfo', salesCustomerInfo)

      /* spinner directive that can be used anywhere across apps */
      .directive('sharedSpinner', sharedSpinner);

  function orderCalendarRange() {
      /* implementation details */
  }

  function salesCustomerInfo() {
      /* implementation details */
  }

  function sharedSpinner() {
      /* implementation details */
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  /* calendar-range.directive.js */

  /**
   * @desc order directive that is specific to the order module at a company named Acme
   * @example <div acme-order-calendar-range></div>
   */
  angular
      .module('sales.order')
      .directive('acmeOrderCalendarRange', orderCalendarRange);

  function orderCalendarRange() {
      /* implementation details */
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  /* customer-info.directive.js */

  /**
   * @desc sales directive that can be used anywhere across the sales app at a company named Acme
   * @example <div acme-sales-customer-info></div>
   */
  angular
      .module('sales.widgets')
      .directive('acmeSalesCustomerInfo', salesCustomerInfo);

  function salesCustomerInfo() {
      /* implementation details */
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  /* spinner.directive.js */

  /**
   * @desc spinner directive that can be used anywhere across apps at a company named Acme
   * @example <div acme-shared-spinner></div>
   */
  angular
      .module('shared.widgets')
      .directive('acmeSharedSpinner', sharedSpinner);

  function sharedSpinner() {
      /* implementation details */
  }
  ```

    Note: There are many naming options for directives, especially since they can be used in narrow or wide scopes. Choose one that makes the directive and its file name distinct and clear. Some examples are below, but see the [Naming](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#naming) section for more recommendations.

### Manipulate DOM in a Directive
###### [Style [Y072](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y072)]

  - When manipulating the DOM directly, use a directive. If alternative ways can be used such as using CSS to set styles or the [animation services](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate), Angular templating, [`ngShow`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngShow) or [`ngHide`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngHide), then use those instead. For example, if the directive simply hides and shows, use ngHide/ngShow.

    *Why?*: DOM manipulation can be difficult to test, debug, and there are often better ways (e.g. CSS, animations, templates)






## Services

### Singletons [Style [Y040](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y040)]
  **input** discuss

  - Services are instantiated with the `new` keyword, use `this` for public methods and variables. Since these are so similar to factories, use a factory instead for consistency.

    Note: [All Angular services are singletons](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/services). This means that there is only one instance of a given service per injector.

  ```javascript
  // service
  angular
      .module('app')
      .service('logger', logger);

  function logger() {
    this.logError = function(msg) {
      /* */
    };
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  // factory
  angular
      .module('app')
      .factory('logger', logger);

  function logger() {
      return {
          logError: function(msg) {
            /* */
          }
     };
  }
  ```


## Data Services

### Separate Data Calls
###### [Style [Y060](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y060)]

  - Refactor logic for making data operations and interacting with data to a factory. Make data services responsible for XHR calls, local storage, stashing in memory, or any other data operations.

    *Why?*: The controller's responsibility is for the presentation and gathering of information for the view. It should not care how it gets the data, just that it knows who to ask for it. Separating the data services moves the logic on how to get it to the data service, and lets the controller be simpler and more focused on the view.

    *Why?*: This makes it easier to test (mock or real) the data calls when testing a controller that uses a data service.

    *Why?*: Data service implementation may have very specific code to handle the data repository. This may include headers, how to talk to the data, or other services such as `$http`. Separating the logic into a data service encapsulates this logic in a single place hiding the implementation from the outside consumers (perhaps a controller), also making it easier to change the implementation.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // dataservice factory
  angular
      .module('app.core')
      .factory('dataservice', dataservice);

  dataservice.$inject = ['$http', 'logger'];

  function dataservice($http, logger) {
      return {
          getAvengers: getAvengers
      };

      function getAvengers() {
          return $http.get('/api/maa')
              .then(getAvengersComplete)
              .catch(getAvengersFailed);

          function getAvengersComplete(response) {
              return response.data.results;
          }

          function getAvengersFailed(error) {
              logger.error('XHR Failed for getAvengers.' + error.data);
          }
      }
  }
  ```

    Note: The data service is called from consumers, such as a controller, hiding the implementation from the consumers, as shown below.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // controller calling the dataservice factory
  angular
      .module('app.avengers')
      .controller('AvengersController', AvengersController);

  AvengersController.$inject = ['dataservice', 'logger'];

  function AvengersController(dataservice, logger) {
      var vm = this;
      vm.avengers = [];

      activate();

      function activate() {
          return getAvengers().then(function() {
              logger.info('Activated Avengers View');
          });
      }

      function getAvengers() {
          return dataservice.getAvengers()
              .then(function(data) {
                  vm.avengers = data;
                  return vm.avengers;
              });
      }
  }
  ```

### Return a Promise from Data Calls
###### [Style [Y061](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y061)]

  - When calling a data service that returns a promise such as `$http`, return a promise in your calling function too.

    *Why?*: You can chain the promises together and take further action after the data call completes and resolves or rejects the promise.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  activate();

  function activate() {
      /**
       * Step 1
       * Ask the getAvengers function for the
       * avenger data and wait for the promise
       */
      return getAvengers().then(function() {
          /**
           * Step 4
           * Perform an action on resolve of final promise
           */
          logger.info('Activated Avengers View');
      });
  }

  function getAvengers() {
        /**
         * Step 2
         * Ask the data service for the data and wait
         * for the promise
         */
        return dataservice.getAvengers()
            .then(function(data) {
                /**
                 * Step 3
                 * set the data and resolve the promise
                 */
                vm.avengers = data;
                return vm.avengers;
        });
  }
  ```



## Factories

###### Single Responsibility [Style [Y050](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y050)]

  - Factories should have a [single responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), that is encapsulated by its context. Once a factory begins to exceed that singular purpose, a new factory should be created.

###### Singletons [Style [Y051](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y051)]

  - Factories are singletons and return an object that contains the members of the service.

    Note: [All Angular services are singletons](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/services).

###### Accessible Members Up Top [Style [Y052](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y052)]

  - Expose the callable members of the service (its interface) at the top, using a technique derived from the [Revealing Module Pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#revealingmodulepatternjavascript).

    *Why?*: Placing the callable members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you instantly identify which members of the service can be called and must be unit tested (and/or mocked).

    *Why?*: This is especially helpful when the file gets longer as it helps avoid the need to scroll to see what is exposed.

    *Why?*: Setting functions as you go can be easy, but when those functions are more than 1 line of code they can reduce the readability and cause more scrolling. Defining the callable interface via the returned service moves the implementation details down, keeps the callable interface up top, and makes it easier to read.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  function dataService() {
    var someValue = '';
    function save() {
      /* */
    };
    function validate() {
      /* */
    };

    return {
        save: save,
        someValue: someValue,
        validate: validate
    };
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  function dataService() {
      var someValue = '';
      var service = {
          save: save,
          someValue: someValue,
          validate: validate
      };
      return service;

      ////////////

      function save() {
          /* */
      };

      function validate() {
          /* */
      };
  }
  ```

  This way bindings are mirrored across the host object, primitive values cannot update alone using the revealing module pattern.

    ![Factories Using "Above the Fold"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/master/a1/assets/above-the-fold-2.png)

### Function Declarations to Hide Implementation Details
###### [Style [Y053](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y053)]

  - Use function declarations to hide implementation details. Keep your accessible members of the factory up top. Point those to function declarations that appears later in the file. For more details see [this post](http://www.johnpapa.net/angular-function-declarations-function-expressions-and-readable-code).

    *Why?*: Placing accessible members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you instantly identify which functions of the factory you can access externally.

    *Why?*: Placing the implementation details of a function later in the file moves that complexity out of view so you can see the important stuff up top.

    *Why?*: Function declarations are hoisted so there are no concerns over using a function before it is defined (as there would be with function expressions).

    *Why?*: You never have to worry with function declarations that moving `var a` before `var b` will break your code because `a` depends on `b`.

    *Why?*: Order is critical with function expressions

  ```javascript
  /**
   * avoid
   * Using function expressions
   */
   function dataservice($http, $location, $q, exception, logger) {
      var isPrimed = false;
      var primePromise;

      var getAvengers = function() {
          // implementation details go here
      };

      var getAvengerCount = function() {
          // implementation details go here
      };

      var service = {
          getAvengerCount: getAvengerCount,
          getAvengers: getAvengers
      };

      return service;
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /**
   * recommended
   * Using function declarations
   * and accessible members up top.
   */
  function dataservice($http, $location, $q, exception, logger) {
      var isPrimed = false;
      var primePromise;

      var service = {
          getAvengerCount: getAvengerCount,
          getAvengers: getAvengers
      };

      return service;

      ////////////

      function getAvengers() {
          // implementation details go here
      }

      function getAvengerCount() {
          // implementation details go here
      }
  }
  ```
  
  
  
## Routing
Client-side routing is important for creating a navigation flow between views and composing views that are made of many smaller templates and directives.

###### [Style [Y270](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y270)]

  - Use the [AngularUI Router](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/) for client-side routing.

    *Why?*: UI Router offers all the features of the Angular router plus a few additional ones including nested routes and states.

    *Why?*: The syntax is quite similar to the Angular router and is easy to migrate to UI Router.

  - Note: You can use a provider such as the `routerHelperProvider` shown below to help configure states across files, during the run phase.

    ```javascript
    // customers.routes.js
    angular
        .module('app.customers')
        .run(appRun);

    /* @ngInject */
    function appRun(routerHelper) {
        routerHelper.configureStates(getStates());
    }

    function getStates() {
        return [
            {
                state: 'customer',
                config: {
                    abstract: true,
                    template: '<ui-view class="shuffle-animation"/>',
                    url: '/customer'
                }
            }
        ];
    }
    ```

    ```javascript
    // routerHelperProvider.js
    angular
        .module('blocks.router')
        .provider('routerHelper', routerHelperProvider);

    routerHelperProvider.$inject = ['$locationProvider', '$stateProvider', '$urlRouterProvider'];
    /* @ngInject */
    function routerHelperProvider($locationProvider, $stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider) {
        /* jshint validthis:true */
        this.$get = RouterHelper;

        $locationProvider.html5Mode(true);

        RouterHelper.$inject = ['$state'];
        /* @ngInject */
        function RouterHelper($state) {
            var hasOtherwise = false;

            var service = {
                configureStates: configureStates,
                getStates: getStates
            };

            return service;

            ///////////////

            function configureStates(states, otherwisePath) {
                states.forEach(function(state) {
                    $stateProvider.state(state.state, state.config);
                });
                if (otherwisePath && !hasOtherwise) {
                    hasOtherwise = true;
                    $urlRouterProvider.otherwise(otherwisePath);
                }
            }

            function getStates() { return $state.get(); }
        }
    }
    ```

###### [Style [Y271](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y271)]

  - Define routes for views in the module where they exist. Each module should contain the routes for the views in the module.

    *Why?*: Each module should be able to stand on its own.

    *Why?*: When removing a module or adding a module, the app will only contain routes that point to existing views.

    *Why?*: This makes it easy to enable or disable portions of an application without concern over orphaned routes.


  

## Filters

###### [Style [Y420](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y420)]

  - Avoid using filters for scanning all properties of a complex object graph. Use filters for select properties.

    *Why?*: Filters can easily be abused and negatively affect performance if not used wisely, for example when a filter hits a large and deep object graph.


## Various Javascript

###### JavaScript Scopes [Style [Y010](//github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#style-y010)]
  - Wrap Angular components in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE).
  - This rule should be ignored while inside the webpack environment

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  var x = 1;
  
  /* recommended */
  (function() {
      'use strict';

      var x = 1;
      ...
  })();
  ```
